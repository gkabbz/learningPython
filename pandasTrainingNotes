Using Pandas

Pandas is a useful module for doing data analysis and transformation work. It works by storing data in either a series or a dataframe

Series

1. A series is a one dimensional labelled array (can be accessed via an index) capable of holding any data type.
e.g. In table below is a series, the index is the row columns (0,1,2)
0   A
1   B
2   C
2. If an index is not defined or called, one is created with a value = 0 - len(data)-1. Therefore for most files, you don't necessary need to define an index.
3. If data is stored in a dictionary pandas will automatically convert the keys into an index. (Question: What if you don't want to?)
4. A series is like a dict, you can get and set values by index label
5. You can assign a name attribute to a series (Question: Not sure how a name attribute is useful)


Dataframe

- A dataframe is a 2 dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It's like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of series objects.
- It is the most commonly used pandas object
- You can optionally pass index(row labels) and columns (column labels) to a dataframe. By doing this however, you are explicitly defining the index and columns of the dataframe.
Therefore a dict of series plus a specific index will discard data not matching up to the passed index.
