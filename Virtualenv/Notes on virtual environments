To setup pyenv environment
1. pyenv virtualenv 3.8.1 iex-stock-data
2. Go into directory
3. pyenv local iex-stock-data (this will set it for the directory only)
4. To deactivate: pyenv local system

After doing this, I got into a problem where I would install the package via command line
but it wouldn't be available in Pycharm. Need to set it up as a virtualenv to be able
to work seemlessly between the terminal and the IDE
