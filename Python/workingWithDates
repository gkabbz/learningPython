This doc captures learnings on how to efficiently work with dates in Python

Unix Time
- In some databases, you may find dates stored as integers / long. e.g. 17195, 17273 or 1485648000, 1492387200.
- This format is unix time and it is a representation of time elapsed since the unix epoch (which was Jan 1 1970)

    Converting unix time to date format
    - If stored as a 5 digit integer:
        Multiply by 86400 (no. of seconds in a day: 17195 * 86400 = 1485648000
    - Once it is in the 10 digit unix epoch time format then convert to date
        In Pyspark:
        - from_unix_time('columnName'.cast(DateType()))
        e.g testInstallCalc = testInstallCalc.withColumn('installDate', from_unixtime('unixInstallDate').cast(DateType()))
