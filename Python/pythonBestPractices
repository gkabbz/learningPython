1. Importing Modules

- There are two ways of importing modules
    1 import random
    2 from random import *

If you use 1, the function would be random.randint(1,10)
If you use 2, the function would be randint(1,10)

My Best Practice: Use 1. Though writing the code is a bit longer, it's a lot more obvious that randint is a function of random for others.
