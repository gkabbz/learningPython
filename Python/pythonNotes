1. Working With Files

Opening Files
There are two ways to open a file. One using the OPEN() function and the other using the "With" statement.
Open() Function:
    file = open('welcome.txt', 'wb')
    date = file.read()
    print(data)
    file.close()

With Statement:
    with open('welcome.txt', 'wb') as file:
        data = file.read()
        print(data)

PROGRAMMING DECLARATION: I will use the With statement exclusively as it removes the need to call file.close() and provides a way for ensuring cleanup is always used as it simplifies exception handling.

file edit modes:
r = read, w = write, a = append, b = open in binary, t = open in text mode, + = open for reading and writing, x = create new file, if already exists operation fails, wb = write binary mode

2. Working With Dates - Using datetime Module
import module:                                  import datetime
current date:                                   datetime.date.today()
current datetime:                               datetime.datetime.now()
current time:
    save current datetime in now variable:      now = datetime.datetime.now()
    create variable that reads time from now:   time = datetime.datetime.time(now)
year from today's date:                         year = datetime.date.today().year
year from a date stored in var dateWanted:      year = dateWanted.year      -> same syntax for month and day
Explicitly storing a date into a var:           dateStore = datetime.date(year=2011, month=1, day=2) will return 2011-01-02



3. Using Requests Module
Requests documentation can be found here: docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
The requests module is great for downloading files from the web where you know the URL and there is no gating i.e. password acccess

res = requests.get('http://site.com/file.txt')  -> will go and grab file.txt contents and store in a variable called res
res.status_code                                 -> will return a status code of the request (200 = successful, ....)
res.text                                        -> will pull the text from the file
res.iter_content(200000)                        -> will work with specified bytes of the data (200000) in this case for writing to a file



4. Working With Strings
Populating a string with variables:             string = "I would like a variable right {} and {}".format(variable 1, variable 2)

5. Using OS Module and Shutil to Work With Files and Folders
The OS module is great for working with files & folders

Check current working directory:                os.getcwd()
Change directory:                               os.chdir('/users/gkaberere/'
Create a directory:                             os.makedirs('/users/gkaberere/testFolderCreate'
Join different folders to create path:          os.path.join('/', folderLevel1, folderLevel2, folderLevel3)
Find directory path in file path:               os.path.dirname('/Users/gkaberere/testfile.txt')
Find file name or last section of file path:    os.path.basename('Users/gkaberere/testfile.txt')
Find the folder contents :                      os.listdir('/users/gkaberere/Google Drive/Python')
Copy a file to a new directory:                 shutil.copy('/users/gkaberere/test.txt', '/users/gkaberere/test/testtest.txt')sd
Rename / Move a file to a/same directory:       shutil.move('/users/gkaberere/test.txt', '/users/gkaberere/testisdone.txt')
Copy an entire folder with all contents:        shutil.copytree('/users/gkaberere/internet', '/users/internet backup')
